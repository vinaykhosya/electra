## Notes

- All endpoints require authentication via Bearer token
- Tokens are obtained via Supabase Auth
- Tokens are available in browser local storage after login
- Parental control relationships are separate from home memberships
- A user can be a home member without being under parental control
- Permissions are tied to home membership (home_member_id)
